analisis_notas.py:

--1
create a Python script called analisis_notas.py that asks the user to enter a list of grades separated by commas. 
The program should process the input and display a summary: total number of grades, average (rounded to like 2 decimals), 
minimum and maximum, percentage of passes (≥5), percentage of excellents (≥9), and the most frequent grade(show all if there’s any ties) 
and then based on the average, print one of the following messages: “Excellent level” (average ≥ 8), “Average level” (5–7.9), or 
“Needs improvement” (average < 5).
Use beginner friendly Python code with clear comments explaining each step. Validate input using try/except to ensure all values are valid numbers. Handle errors like empty input, extra spaces, or invalid data gracefully. Use f-strings for output formatting and import necessary modules like statistics.
Also don't use imports and just simple code
